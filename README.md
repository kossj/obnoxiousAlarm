# obnoxiousAlarm
🎤 ⏰ 🚀
An obnoxious alarm powered by a car horn, and a good excuse to tinker with IOT.

## What does it do?

When an Alexa alarm goes off, an IFTT integration puts a 1 on an Adafruit IO feed.
When the alarm is dismissed either via Alexa or button on alarm, a O is sent to the Adafruit feed.
